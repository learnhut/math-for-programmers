# Lesson 9: Variables - Letters That Represent Numbers

## Concept Introduction

In mathematics, a **variable** is a symbol (usually a letter) that represents a number whose value we don't know yet, or a number that can change. Think of variables as empty boxes with labels - the box labeled "x" can hold different numbers at different times.

The most common variables are letters like x, y, and z, but mathematicians can use any letter. Variables allow us to write general rules and solve problems without knowing specific numbers upfront.

## Building Understanding

### What Variables Represent

Variables can represent different things depending on the context:

**Unknown values** - numbers we're trying to find:
- "Find x where x + 5 = 12"
- Here, x represents the mystery number that makes this equation true

**Changing values** - numbers that vary in a situation:
- "Let h represent the height of a growing plant"
- Here, h changes as days pass

**General relationships** - patterns that work for any number:
- "The perimeter of a square is 4s, where s is the side length"
- Here, s can be any positive number

### Algebraic Expressions vs Equations

An **algebraic expression** contains variables and operations but no equals sign:
- 3x + 7
- 2y - 5
- xÂ² + 4x + 1

An **equation** sets two expressions equal to each other:
- 3x + 7 = 19
- 2y - 5 = 11
- xÂ² + 4x + 1 = 0

### Key Vocabulary

**Coefficient**: The number multiplied by a variable
- In 5x, the coefficient is 5
- In -3y, the coefficient is -3
- In x (which is really 1x), the coefficient is 1

**Like terms**: Terms that have the same variable raised to the same power
- 3x and 7x are like terms
- 2yÂ² and -5yÂ² are like terms
- 3x and 3y are NOT like terms

**Constant**: A number without a variable
- In the expression 2x + 7, the constant is 7

## Examples

### Example 1: Evaluating Expressions
If x = 4, find the value of 3x + 2.

**Solution:**
Substitute 4 for x:
3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14

### Example 2: Combining Like Terms
Simplify: 5x + 3x - 2x

**Solution:**
All terms have the same variable (x), so we can combine:
5x + 3x - 2x = (5 + 3 - 2)x = 6x

### Example 3: Evaluating with Multiple Variables
If a = 3 and b = 7, find the value of 2a + 3b - 5.

**Solution:**
Substitute the values:
2(3) + 3(7) - 5 = 6 + 21 - 5 = 22

### Example 4: Identifying Parts of Expressions
In the expression 4xÂ² - 7x + 12, identify:
- The coefficient of xÂ²: 4
- The coefficient of x: -7
- The constant term: 12

### Example 5: Writing Expressions from Words
"Three times a number plus eight"

**Solution:**
Let the unknown number be n.
Expression: 3n + 8

## ðŸŽ¯ Try This: The Mystery Number Game

Think of a number (but don't tell anyone what it is). Call your number n.

1. Double your number: 2n
2. Add 10: 2n + 10
3. Divide by 2: (2n + 10) Ã· 2 = n + 5
4. Subtract your original number: (n + 5) - n = 5

No matter what number you started with, you'll always end up with 5! This shows the power of variables - they let us prove that mathematical patterns work for any number.

Try creating your own "number trick" using variables to show why it works.

## ðŸ’» Where You'll See This in Programming

Mathematical variables work exactly like programming variables - they're both containers that hold values. However, there are some key differences in how they're used:

**Similarities:**
- Both store values that can change
- Both use substitution (replacing the variable with its value)
- Both follow the same mathematical rules for operations

**Differences:**
- Math variables often represent unknowns we're solving for
- Programming variables usually store known data we're processing
- Math variables can represent infinite possibilities; code variables hold specific values at specific times

**Examples in code:**
```
// Mathematical thinking: "Let x represent the user's age"
int userAge = getUserInput();

// Mathematical expression: 2x + 5
int result = 2 * userAge + 5;

// This is exactly like mathematical substitution!
```

Understanding mathematical variables helps you:
- Choose meaningful variable names
- Write expressions that mirror mathematical formulas
- Debug equations in your code
- Understand algorithm descriptions that use mathematical notation
